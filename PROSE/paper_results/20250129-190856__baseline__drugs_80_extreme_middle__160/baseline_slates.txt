Contextless zero shot slate:
My experience with Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone has been overwhelmingly positive. It regulated my periods, cleared my acne, and gave me a sense of control over my body. I haven’t experienced any major side effects, and I feel confident using this medication as part of my routine.
It works well enough for me, but I do experience mood swings and some nausea occasionally. While it’s effective for birth control and cycle regulation, these side effects make it less than perfect for me.
The side effects have been too much for me to handle—constant bloating, headaches, and emotional ups and downs. I stopped taking it because I didn’t feel like myself anymore.
It caused me significant issues like weight gain and unpredictable spotting. I’ve decided to try something else because this medication just isn’t for me.
I didn’t notice much of an effect at all, positive or negative—it just wasn’t the right choice for me.

Zero shot slate:
This medication has been an absolute nightmare for me. My anxiety, mood swings, and depression have worsened dramatically since starting it. My periods have become irregular and extremely painful, and the side effects have made me feel like I’m losing control of myself. I cannot recommend this to anyone.
I experienced terrible weight gain and breakouts after taking this pill. Despite following a strict diet and exercise plan, I haven’t been able to shed the weight even after stopping the pill. It’s completely thrown my body out of balance and I regret trying it.
My experience has been awful. I’ve had severe nausea, constant bleeding, abdominal cramps, and intense headaches. My mental health has also been affected, making me irritable and emotional. I gave this pill a chance, but I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone else.
The side effects of this pill made me feel terrible—headaches, nausea, bloating, and zero energy. My periods became unpredictable and heavy. While it may work for some, it just didn’t work for my body.
This birth control has been effective in preventing pregnancy, although I’ve experienced minor side effects like nausea and acne. It’s been manageable overall and did help regulate my period after the first few months.
I’ve had a great experience with this medication. It cleared up my acne, regulated my periods, and made my cycles lighter and more predictable. I’m happy with the results and would recommend it to others trying to manage similar issues.
This pill has been a game-changer for me. Minimal side effects and no periods, which I love. I’ve had clearer skin, steady moods, and it’s been a reliable form of contraception. Definitely worth sticking with.
