Contextless zero shot slate:
This medication works really well for me in controlling my menstrual cycles and reducing cramps. I’ve had no major side effects, and it’s been a life-changing solution for me.
It’s mostly fine, but I do experience mood swings and mild nausea occasionally. It’s effective overall, but the side effects can be a bit frustrating.
I don’t like using this medication. It caused me severe headaches and weight gain, so I had to stop. It just did not work for me.
Honestly, it didn’t change much for me. My cycles are still irregular, and I’m not sure if it’s worth continuing.
I’ve had a great experience with this medication. It cleared up my acne and regulated my hormones, so I feel much better overall.
The side effects like dizziness and spotting made it unbearable for me. I had to switch to something else.

Zero shot slate:
This medication was devastating for me. It caused severe side effects like persistent acne, mood swings, weight gain, and intense cramps. I would never recommend it to anyone.
I experienced horrible nausea, moodiness, and spotting in the early months, but things improved over time. It helped lighten and regulate my periods, and now I’m mostly fine on it.
I’ve experienced some discomfort, but overall it’s effective at preventing pregnancy and hasn’t been unbearable. Side effects vary, but they’re manageable for me.
This pill has been great! My periods are lighter, my acne has cleared, and I don’t deal with cramps anymore. I highly recommend it!

Clustered slate:
Deadly drug.
This medication ruined my health completely.
This pill is a nightmare—weight gain, breakouts, and awful side effects!
This birth control has been a nightmare for me—constant bleeding, horrible acne, mood swings, and unbearable cramps. It’s just not worth the pain and frustration.
This birth control wreaked havoc on my body—weight gain, no libido, mood swings—never again.
This pill is a nightmare. The severe cramping, irregular bleeding, mood swings, and other distressing effects make continuing it feel unbearable and unhealthy.
This pill is life-changing when used correctly. Stick through the initial side effects, take it at the same time daily, and you'll see amazing results!
Honestly, this pill is a game-changer—clear skin, no weight gain, no wild side effects, and barely any periods. Totally worth every penny!
This pill can be tough at first, but sticking with it is worth the positive changes later!
Adjusting takes time, but overall it's effective!
