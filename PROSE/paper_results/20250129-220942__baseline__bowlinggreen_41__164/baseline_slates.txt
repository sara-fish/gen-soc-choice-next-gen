Contextless zero shot slate:
Bowling Green desperately needs better road infrastructure. The traffic is unbearable during peak hours, and the road conditions are poor. Expanding roads and improving maintenance should be a top priority.
We need more activities and attractions for families and young people. Investing in parks, community centers, and events would help bring the community together. Bowling Green has potential, but it feels stagnant.
Affordable housing should be a focus. Prices are climbing, and it's becoming harder for young families and low-income residents to stay here. More housing developments with reasonable prices are necessary.
Public transportation here is almost nonexistent. We need better bus routes and other transport options for those who don’t drive, especially for seniors and students.
The city could benefit from attracting more diverse businesses. Local jobs are great, but more opportunities in technology or creative industries would bring growth.
Investing in education and local schools is key. Schools need better funding, resources, and attention.
Bowling Green is fine as it is. People complain too much.

Zero shot slate:
We desperately need faster, more reliable internet across Bowling Green and Warren County, especially in underserved areas like Alvaton.
Traffic in Bowling Green is a nightmare. The Bypass doesn't function like a real bypass, and Fairview Avenue near Kereiakes Park needs a roundabout to improve flow.
Schools at all levels need daily physical activity to combat childhood obesity. It’s not optional—it’s a necessity for our kids.
Refugees and immigrants enrich our city. We should implement programs to integrate them better into our community and celebrate their contributions.
Build a homeless park with tiny homes and a central donation center. Our city has to care for its most vulnerable.
Roads and infrastructure should improve alongside new developments. We can’t keep approving projects without a plan for traffic and utilities.
More needs to be done to protect animals. Bowling Green should ban chaining pets and enforce spay/neuter programs through fines.
More affordable, accessible transportation for seniors and disabled residents would make life better for everyone.
Enforcing traffic laws like speeding, running red lights, and expired tags would improve safety and bring in more revenue for the city.
We need more housing options for renters that allow pets, and landlords should be held accountable to maintain their properties.

Clustered slate:
Fairview Ave desperately needs a traffic circle at Kereiakes Park to fix the chaotic flow and reduce reckless driving through red lights.
Internet should be a publicly managed utility, with residential fiber access prioritized. BGMU must lead, ensuring equitable, high-speed internet for all Warren County residents.
Parking laws need strict enforcement—cars clogging streets or ignoring rules create chaos and danger. Police should actively ticket violators and restore order.
Comprehensive, accurate sex education is essential to combat teen pregnancy and STDs.
The school district boundaries and overcrowding issues in Warren County need serious attention. Redistricting and building new schools could better balance student numbers and meet the demands of a growing population.
Bowling Green desperately needs to address its traffic chaos; adding turn lanes, blocking left turns on busy roads, and improving traffic flow should be top priorities for the city!
Landlords must ensure safe, affordable rentals; no more overpriced, run-down units!
Refugees are welcome!
