Dizziness blurry vision but the first month had constant headaches. After that, I ate very little and got full fast. I even quit drinking. It also helped with my depression and energy. I been off of it for 6 months and have gained 10lbs. Food cravings and depression are back. Have to wait 6 months for an appointment to get a refill. I am dependent on it.""",8,Contrave,Obesity,96,97

60,user39806,"""So I started this drug because I have PCOS. I started 8/21/2015  I have reduced my calorie intake at first to 2,500 during first month and down to 1,800 on the second month. I have kept on taking them and keeping to the low calorie intake  and am now on my 4th month. I followed the dosage that was in my packet now I am taking 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening. I went through some of the side effect symptoms as I progressed, such as nausea , headache, and dry mouth. I have lost 36.4 pounds at an average loss of 1/2 a day. I plan to continue taking it as long as my loss stays like this.""",8,Contrave,Obesity,16,122
61,user39621,"""  Most insurance companies won&#039;t pay for this drug since its a diet pill.    I agree with everyone about it helping to control your appetite and help you &quot;maintain&quot; after you are done with the medication.  This is an addicting drug, so you don&#039;t want to be on it for long.      I lost 35 lbs, it took me a year, but I am able to maintain now. I weigh myself every other day and if I gain a few, I watch myself for the next few days.  FYI, I didn&#039;t really exercise either.    Just my thoughts.  Good luck to you all!!!""",8,Contrave,Obesity,15,101

Now that I&#039;m on the full dosage for about 2 weeks now I am noticing more of a nausea feeling for the past few days. I&#039;ve lost about 13lbs so it does works for me. However I don&#039;t believe I&#039;ll be taking for too much longer due to the nausea feeling.   FYI - If you eat any grease or fried foods you will definitely feel the affects. It does force you to think about what you are eating and how it affects you.""",8,Contrave,Obesity,11,114

I actually managed to have some old period blood come out.  The second day I had a light headache, but nothing too serious.  My third day I had a salad with vinegar and oil.  (Your appetite is cut dramatically on this pill btw.  You will end up eating less than 1,000 calories a day.  ).Ended up getting the chills and migraine until I vomited my salad.

My doctor wants to try weight loss before taking any diabetic meds.  I&#039;m now at 276 after a week, working everyday to eat each meal healthy.  I&#039;ve even tried a few smoothies, and baby kale (which by the way, isn&#039;t yucky like regular kale). :)  I&#039;m feeling really good about my attempt this time, the medicine so far has not presented any side effects except a dry mouth, which is sort of annoying, but not too bad.
