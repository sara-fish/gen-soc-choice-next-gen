With this birth control, I knew exactly when I would start my period and what day I would get off my period. It was like clockwork that never seemed to fail. My period was a tad shorter and it was definitely lighter overall (aside from the first day). This BC didn&#039;t do much for my cramps. I didn&#039;t have any side effects such as moodiness or weight gain, that I seemed to notice. My reason for getting off this BC though is because it made me breakout like crazy. Before, I rarely had so much as a pimple. With this BC, I didn&#039;t feel comfortable going out without makeup because my complexion got so bad.""\n\n**Output instructions:**\nComplete the following entries:\n- most_important_aspects (List[str]): List the aspects of the topic that are most important to the user.

""Been on this for a week now. So far my acne has cleared up. Breasts have noticeably gotten larger. Sex drive is definitely higher (and more enjoyable). Some food cravings but not larger appetite. Just want certain things. Had slight tension headaches and mild nausea first few days, however increasing my water intake helped dissipate these symptoms. Slight moodiness first few days similar to PMS but less intense. Some loose stools. On day 8 and feeling great. The body was just getting used to the new hormones. The boyfriend loves the noticeably larger breasts and increased sex drive.""
